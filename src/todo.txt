Frontend:
- send a confirmation email when someone has made a page
- Create the profile page for the deceased
    * need to fix the 'Add to database btn and find working solution'
- has a specific route for each profile when created. 
    * maybe for this we could add a key to walldatactx and use that in the route?
- when making a page link it to create Launchgood or Gofundme automatically

Backend:
- Create a database for all deceased profiles.
- database must be able to update 
- create commands to search through the database
- Save the cloudinary 'public_id' into the database to be able to fetch it and display per profile.
