Frontend:
- send a confirmation email when someone has made a page
- Create the profile page for the deceased // half done need to find solution
    * need to fix the 'Add to database btn and find working solution'
- has a specific route for each profile when created. 
    * maybe for this we could add a key to walldatactx and use that in the route?
- when making a page link it to create Launchgood or Gofundme automatically

Backend:
- Create a database for all deceased profiles.
- database must be able to CRUD
- create commands to search through the database
- Save the cloudinary 'public_id' into the database to be able to fetch it and display per profile.

    * the public_id can be used as the specific key for the profile - what if they change the photo?

ISSUES:
Create component:
 - need to disable create a wall if there the form isn't filled out or if add to database hasn't been clicked


Profile component:

 - Anyone can change the photo need to have some sort of authentication (confirm by email) to change it
 - Need to have a delete function for the specific comment made by the user (confirm by email)
 - Need to make it so its one like per comment per user
